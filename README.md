# Vue Example

> This example shows that how the components communicate each other.
> * Passing data from parent to child components with Props.
> * Sending notification from child to parent components with Events.
> 
> See a demo at [https://codesandbox.io/s/github/webther/Vue-Example-Components-Communication](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/webther/Vue-Example-Components-Communication)
> 
> <h4><i>Note: In a large application, we should use Vuex to manage the state instead of the default Props and Events.</i></h4>
